What? What am I doing?&10;&10;What is my home? On the internet is the blog post title maybe.&10;&10;So in order of things that I have on the internet, obviously I have my blog, chrisenns.com. I post micro blog, which then cross post blue sky mast on and threads ish. I have an email newsletter host on button down that I used to be good at posting once a month, once a week, maybe even now. I haven't posted in over a year.&10;&10;Uh, I have a Discord, various Discord communities I'm a part of that I post into and I'm, but also building, uh, one. Just for myself, maybe community kind of thing. I have various podcasts and ideas. I have various podcast ideas, littered across transistor fm. Thanks Justin. And I have an Instagram that I post to once a year if I'm lucky, and occasionally on stories when I'm bored.&10;&10;I've got my Twitch channel, lemon casting that I'm posting. On weekly ish and having fun with that. And then YouTube is sort of like a secondary home for whatever gets posted on Twitch. And then also other random tutorial videos that I make. So obviously my blog and vanity domain name chans.com should be my home base, but I don't love the way it ghost the CMS.&10;&10;I'm using handles emails and blog posts as sort of one thing, more or less if I wanna send an email to everyone who's subscribed to me. And says they wanna find out about me. I don't wanna have to think about how I'd write that as a blog post, which lives on the internet, even though at the end of the day, those are essentially the same things, just like a page on the internet link somewhere and packaged up into an email and sent to people, which is why I like sort of the separation of concerns of button down being the email newsletter thing.\">\n",

I keep a personal Instagram account mainly to keep up with friends and family.  There&rsquo;s a couple accounts I follow who use it as a traditional photography app - for the rest it&rsquo;s all status updates in visual form. I go back and forth between using it to post an interesting photo I took (Instagram v1 style), and posting 9 photos and a video of a family camping trip (Instagram v5? style).</p>\n<p>I also have a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lemonpodcasting/\">business account</a> because I feel like I should - but I use it in spurts, and really could delete it without any noticeable impact on my business other than the time it would free up from me feeling like I need to check it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"instagram-for-my-kids\">Instagram For My Kids</h3>\n<p>Seeing how my kids use Instagram, I want to hurl the app into the sun and watch it burn for a thousand years. We&rsquo;ve given our oldest 2 Instagram accounts in order to keep up with youth group activities, and naturally they&rsquo;ve connected with friends and family as well.

It is all about marketing and pushing substandard products and mediocre services pushed by influencers with less depth than a sheet of paper.\n\n### Instagram For Me\n\nInstagram replaced Facebook for me as the place to keep up with what friends or family might be doing. I keep a personal Instagram account mainly to keep up with friends and family.  There's a couple accounts I follow who use it as a traditional photography app - for the rest it's all status updates in visual form. I go back and forth between using it to post an interesting photo I took (Instagram v1 style), and posting 9 photos and a video of a family camping trip (Instagram v5? style).\n\nI also have a [business account](https://www.instagram.com/lemonpodcasting/) because I feel like I should - but I use it in spurts, and really could delete it without any noticeable impact on my business other than the time it would free up from me feeling like I need to check it.\n\n### Instagram For My Kids\n\nSeeing how my kids use Instagram, I want to hurl the app into the sun and watch it burn for a thousand years.

Many leaders are fearful these days. That fear shapes a leadership culture of defensiveness rather than openness. Voices of disagreement are threatening when denominations and churches face peril on multiple levels (declining attendance, closure of facilities, damage control after scandals, reduction of budgets and staff, challenges to old patriarchal assumptions, etc.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Three critical qualities are needed in both local and national leadership as we hurl through the chaos and upheaval of these changing times. (1) Absolutely essential is the capacity for self-reflection and the ability to see oneself as others would see them. We are dead in the water without the wind of self-awareness. (2) Similarly, the need for empathy and the desire to empathically hear and feel those that are voiceless, marginalized, and victimized on the edges, without leaders projecting their own pain onto those that have been hurt by leaders&rsquo; actions (red flag warning: &ldquo;It hurts me to do this, but&hellip;&rdquo;). (3) Finally, rather than belittling and controlling, leaders should focus on empowering members into new thoughts and experiences without feeling threatened and without seeing leadership&rsquo;s primary role as theological gatekeeper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When leadership acts out of fear, and without empathy, the community they are trying to lead are pushed to anger or apathy - neither of which bring peace or love back to the community.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "My friend Tim Neufeld, from my [@U2 fan site and podcast days](https://atu2.com), [posted his thoughts](https://www.facebook.com/653088603/posts/pfbid028afCNJ7dh7uZ2TZRXTbY8ALWUrz9QVtGkJZxRn1uRgeQjqdBkpTt4jk7wYwSRh5wl/?d=n) about an [article published in the MB Herald](https://mbherald.com/on-holy-ground-book-reprinted-at-request-of-usmb-and-ccmbc-boards/) detailing the mess that the [Canadian Conference of of Mennonite Brethren Churches](https://www.mennonitebrethren.ca) and their US equivalent, [USMB](https://usmb.org), made of a recent book they published, and then quickly pulled and removed 3 pages, and have now republished - all without talking to the author, editor, or anyone involved in the publishing of the book.\n\nSetting that mess aside, my point in mentioning all of that is part of what Tim wrote hit way too close to home here in my own church that I was compelled to document it  below:\n\n> …but one value I have always prioritized is to honor voices of diversity, not just in theory but in practice. Many leaders are fearful these days. That fear shapes a leadership culture of defensiveness rather than openness. Voices of disagreement are threatening when denominations and churches face peril on multiple levels (declining attendance, closure of facilities, damage control after scandals, reduction of budgets and staff, challenges to old patriarchal assumptions, etc.).\n\n> Three critical qualities are needed in both local and national leadership as we hurl through the chaos and upheaval of these changing times. (1) Absolutely essential is the capacity for self-reflection and the ability to see oneself as others would see them. We are dead in the water without the wind of self-awareness. (2) Similarly, the need for empathy and the desire to empathically hear and feel those that are voiceless, marginalized, and victimized on the edges, without leaders projecting their own pain onto those that have been hurt by leaders' actions (red flag warning: \"It hurts me to do this, but...\"). (3) Finally, rather than belittling and controlling, leaders should focus on empowering members into new thoughts and experiences without feeling threatened and without seeing leadership's primary role as theological gatekeeper.\n\nWhen leadership acts out of fear, and without empathy, the community they are trying to lead are pushed to anger or apathy - neither of which bring peace or love back to the community.\n",
