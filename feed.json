What? What am I doing?&10;&10;What is my home? On the internet is the blog post title maybe.&10;&10;So in order of things that I have on the internet, obviously I have my blog, chrisenns.com. I post micro blog, which then cross post blue sky mast on and threads ish. I have an email newsletter host on button down that I used to be good at posting once a month, once a week, maybe even now. I haven't posted in over a year.&10;&10;Uh, I have a Discord, various Discord communities I'm a part of that I post into and I'm, but also building, uh, one. Just for myself, maybe community kind of thing. I have various podcasts and ideas. I have various podcast ideas, littered across transistor fm. Thanks Justin. And I have an Instagram that I post to once a year if I'm lucky, and occasionally on stories when I'm bored.&10;&10;I've got my Twitch channel, lemon casting that I'm posting. On weekly ish and having fun with that. And then YouTube is sort of like a secondary home for whatever gets posted on Twitch. And then also other random tutorial videos that I make. So obviously my blog and vanity domain name chans.com should be my home base, but I don't love the way it ghost the CMS.&10;&10;I'm using handles emails and blog posts as sort of one thing, more or less if I wanna send an email to everyone who's subscribed to me. And says they wanna find out about me. I don't wanna have to think about how I'd write that as a blog post, which lives on the internet, even though at the end of the day, those are essentially the same things, just like a page on the internet link somewhere and packaged up into an email and sent to people, which is why I like sort of the separation of concerns of button down being the email newsletter thing.\">\n",
