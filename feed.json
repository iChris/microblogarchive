And I also took a deeper nerd dive and have started using [Warp](https://www.warp.dev) in place of the default Terminal app for the few times I dip into command line world.\n\n## Why Warp?\n\nI'll skip talking much about Warp because it's way out of my depth in terms of benefits or reasons why a proper developer should use it - but for a newbie like me, the main reason I like it is because it makes the Terminal and command line world much more user friendly to dig into. The secondary reason is that a lot of my [clients](https://www.lemonproductions.ca/portfolio/) won't stop talking about it. :)\n\n## Why Raycast?\n\nWith Raycast however, it's because of how similar it feels to using Spotlight that I've decided to make the switch. It's fast (or faster) than Spotlight is at finding an app I need to run, or a document I've been working on. And I can slowly build up muscle memory with all the [extensions](https://www.raycast.com/store) available for Raycast.\n\nHere's a few extensions I've been using:\n\n- The main extension I started using is for [Toggl](https://toggl.com) - [Toggl Track](https://www.raycast.com/franzwilhelm/toggl-track), a time tracking app I use to track my work. With a couple quick keyboard shortcuts, I can start a timer for a podcast or video I'm editing, and don't have to think about it again. \n- The [Twitter extension](https://www.raycast.com/tonka3000/twitter) is also handy for quickly seeing tweets I've recently sent, or finding a user or tweet that I need to reference for a client's episode notes.\n- [Emoji Search](https://www.raycast.com/FezVrasta/emoji) is a handy way to find an emoji when I don't have my MacBook Pro Touch Bar within reach.\n- [Notion](https://www.raycast.com/HenriChabrand/notion) is an easy way to search or start a new page inside Notion.\n- Raycast's own confetti extension is handy for quickly celebrating a win all by myself. 🎉🎊\n- [Apple Notes](https://www.raycast.com/tumtum/apple-notes) search is super handy for quickly finding the note with our van's license plate or the size of that basement window.\n- [Savvycal](https://www.raycast.com/laurynas/savvycal) allows me to quickly grab a meeting link to send to a client.\n\nRaycast could also replace TextExpander with their [Snippets](https://manual.raycast.com/snippets) feature. I've just started using them for new shortcuts I need, but I can see myself gradually replacing TextExpander with this if it works as well for all my other snippets as it has so far.\n\nThere is also [Window Management](https://manual.raycast.com/window-management) built into Raycast that could potentially replace [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com/pro) as my current app of choice for moving windows around automagically with shortcuts.\n\nIn addition to all the features of the app, Raycast also has some great [wallpapers](https://www.raycast.com/wallpapers) for your Mac or iOS device of choice.\n\nI know I'm barely scratching the surface of what Raycast - and especially Warp - can do to make my podcast editing business life easier on my Mac, but it's fun to feel a little more like a power user again after not messing around with it too much in recent years.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1068/2022/cd77b57c5a.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"391\" alt=\"Screenshot of Raycast with a few options in the list for tracking time, launching Logic Pro, Remote Desktop, emoji search.\">\n",

Slave owners insured their property (including their slaves) and would get up to 75% of their investment back when slaves died, so plantation owners had every incentive to work everyone to death, making many times over what they paid thanks to their free labor and when their slaves did die, owners were rewarded by recouping most of their original investment. The entire economic system was designed to support it.\n\nI know here in Canada we have our own [reckoning with the past](https://nctr.ca) that we continue to make a mess of even today, in light of all that we know. \n\nI don't have the answers for how to heal from the past atrocities. But I do know that actively working to deny they happened is [among the worst ways to process and help healing](https://twitter.com/mathowie/status/1547634835904090115?s=21&t=-C0x5dgGbj9kWDEBygTCcA):\n\n> I feel like the rise in conspiracy theories is due to so much more concrete information and data out there and people saying they can’t possibly believe what they see with their own eyes, instead it just HAS to be something else that doesn’t undermine their own beliefs.\n",

Obviously I have no insider knowledge on usage stats from Spotify or Apple, but <a href=\"https://rachsmith.com/spotify-podcasts-should-be-a-separate-app/\">Rachel Smith&rsquo;s experience sums up the sentiment I keep hearing from Spotify users</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the blessed pre-Spotify Podcasts days, I was a huge Spotify fan. I was paying for a subscription as soon as it was available in my region. Now I curse Spotify whenever they take away podcast content I previously enjoyed: Brené Brown, basically all of Gimlet. I say &ldquo;take away&rdquo; because I refuse to use their shitty excuse for a podcast-app-shoved-in-a-music-player that has made my once-great-music-player experience worse! Damn you Spotify, I won&rsquo;t do it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like I said, without actual user data it&rsquo;s impossible for me to say &ldquo;Spotify&rsquo;s approach is economically worse than Apple&rsquo;s&rdquo;, and I don&rsquo;t know what kind of testing Spotify is doing to determine if a separate app would generate more revenue, but it certainly <em>feels</em> like it&rsquo;s a better experience over all.</p>\n",

Initially I was skeptical that it made sense - why not have podcasts in the same \"store\" as where everyone was already going for music or movies or TV? It's all media.\n\nNow 3 years later it really looks like it was the right choice, at least from a user experience perspective. Obviously I have no insider knowledge on usage stats from Spotify or Apple, but [Rachel Smith's experience sums up the sentiment I keep hearing from Spotify users](https://rachsmith.com/spotify-podcasts-should-be-a-separate-app/):\n\n> In the blessed pre-Spotify Podcasts days, I was a huge Spotify fan. I was paying for a subscription as soon as it was available in my region. Now I curse Spotify whenever they take away podcast content I previously enjoyed: Brené Brown, basically all of Gimlet. I say \"take away\" because I refuse to use their shitty excuse for a podcast-app-shoved-in-a-music-player that has made my once-great-music-player experience worse! Damn you Spotify, I won't do it.\n\nLike I said, without actual user data it's impossible for me to say \"Spotify's approach is economically worse than Apple's\", and I don't know what kind of testing Spotify is doing to determine if a separate app would generate more revenue, but it certainly *feels* like it's a better experience over all.\n",
