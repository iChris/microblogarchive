<p>One that triggers an instant &ldquo;Ooh I want that!&rdquo; is the sound of someone drinking something with ice. It could be iced coffee, pop, alcoholic beverage, soda water, juice - I have no idea what&rsquo;s actually in the glass. But that clinking sound of ice in a cup as it&rsquo;s being tilted up to someone&rsquo;s mouth and then back down triggers an almost pavlovian response in my brain to want to go get myself some sort of drink with ice in it.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://microblog.chrisenns.com/2022/10/06/breaking-my-macos.html">Breaking My macOS Rule of Not Replacing Default Mac Apps with Raycast and Warp</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://microblog.chrisenns.com/2022/10/06/breaking-my-macos.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-10-06 12:13:08 -0600">Oct 6, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I think it might have been <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa">John Siracusa</a> who I first heard articulate this out loud on a podcast: Don&rsquo;t replace macOS built in functionality if you can&rsquo;t easily replicate that when you go to use a different Mac computer without that app or plugin built in.</p>
<p>Some of the common examples at the time were apps like <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>, <a href="https://www.cocoatech.io">Path Finder</a>, or <a href="https://textexpander.com">TextExpander</a> - apps that added features or functionality that I would feel lost without when I went to troubleshoot a friend or family member&rsquo;s Mac.</p>
<p>Gradually I&rsquo;ve been more and more ok with using apps even though they change the fundamental macOS experience - TextExpander being the main one I&rsquo;ve grown so accustomed to having over the years.</p>
<p>Recently I decided to change the default shortcut - ⌘-Spacebar - for Spotlight that made me realize I had replaced core functionality in macOS with a 3rd party app: <a href="https://www.raycast.com">Raycast</a>. And I also took a deeper nerd dive and have started using <a href="https://www.warp.dev">Warp</a> in place of the default Terminal app for the few times I dip into command line world.</p>
<h2 id="why-warp">Why Warp?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll skip talking much about Warp because it&rsquo;s way out of my depth in terms of benefits or reasons why a proper developer should use it - but for a newbie like me, the main reason I like it is because it makes the Terminal and command line world much more user friendly to dig into. The secondary reason is that a lot of my <a href="https://www.lemonproductions.ca/portfolio/">clients</a> won&rsquo;t stop talking about it. :)</p>
<h2 id="why-raycast">Why Raycast?</h2>
<p>With Raycast however, it&rsquo;s because of how similar it feels to using Spotlight that I&rsquo;ve decided to make the switch. It&rsquo;s fast (or faster) than Spotlight is at finding an app I need to run, or a document I&rsquo;ve been working on. And I can slowly build up muscle memory with all the <a href="https://www.raycast.com/store">extensions</a> available for Raycast.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few extensions I&rsquo;ve been using:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main extension I started using is for <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a> - <a href="https://www.raycast.com/franzwilhelm/toggl-track">Toggl Track</a>, a time tracking app I use to track my work. With a couple quick keyboard shortcuts, I can start a timer for a podcast or video I&rsquo;m editing, and don&rsquo;t have to think about it again.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.raycast.com/tonka3000/twitter">Twitter extension</a> is also handy for quickly seeing tweets I&rsquo;ve recently sent, or finding a user or tweet that I need to reference for a client&rsquo;s episode notes.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.raycast.com/FezVrasta/emoji">Emoji Search</a> is a handy way to find an emoji when I don&rsquo;t have my MacBook Pro Touch Bar within reach.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.raycast.com/HenriChabrand/notion">Notion</a> is an easy way to search or start a new page inside Notion.</li>
<li>Raycast&rsquo;s own confetti extension is handy for quickly celebrating a win all by myself. 🎉🎊</li>
<li><a href="https://www.raycast.com/tumtum/apple-notes">Apple Notes</a> search is super handy for quickly finding the note with our van&rsquo;s license plate or the size of that basement window.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.raycast.com/laurynas/savvycal">Savvycal</a> allows me to quickly grab a meeting link to send to a client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Raycast could also replace TextExpander with their <a href="https://manual.raycast.com/snippets">Snippets</a> feature. I&rsquo;ve just started using them for new shortcuts I need, but I can see myself gradually replacing TextExpander with this if it works as well for all my other snippets as it has so far.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://manual.raycast.com/window-management">Window Management</a> built into Raycast that could potentially replace <a href="https://rectangleapp.com/pro">Rectangle Pro</a> as my current app of choice for moving windows around automagically with shortcuts.</p>
<p>In addition to all the features of the app, Raycast also has some great <a href="https://www.raycast.com/wallpapers">wallpapers</a> for your Mac or iOS device of choice.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m barely scratching the surface of what Raycast - and especially Warp - can do to make my podcast editing business life easier on my Mac, but it&rsquo;s fun to feel a little more like a power user again after not messing around with it too much in recent years.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>11 months ago my father-in-law died unexpectedly. I&rsquo;ve recognized that my body is processing the shock and trauma of current events in my life in very similar ways to that time period 11 months ago, even though in the big scheme of things current events in my life aren&rsquo;t as impactful as a sudden death.</p>
<p>Something I unlocked in my brain about myself through this, is recognizing that when my body is processing trauma:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m not going to be as productive.</li>
<li>I need to be ok with slowing down.</li>
<li>Efficiency can’t be the priority.</li>
<li>I need to get away from work and touch grass when the night brain voices try to take over.</li>
<li>Some things just aren&rsquo;t going to make sense, and justice may never be realized, because we as humans seek to preserve the reality we see, and fight hard to let anything in that might break or challenge our perception of reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the hurt and anger threaten to overwhelm, and I feel like my body is going to physically explode. In other moments, the grief is so debilitating that I find it hard to breath between the tears. Up until these two events over the past year, I didn&rsquo;t recognize how exhausting it is when your body is physically processing something like this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so important to recognize that, if we are able to, give ourselves space and time to rest and recover and know that this is not forever - our body, mind, and spirit will heal just like if we broke our arm. There will be scars that remain long after, but you - and I - will be able to heal if we take care of ourselves through the traumatic event.</p>
<h3 id="a-few-random-thoughts-as-this-tweet-turned-into-a-blog-post-that-turned-into-a-oversharing-rambling-journal-entry">A few random thoughts as this tweet turned into a blog post that turned into a oversharing rambling journal entry:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not going to share publicly about what&rsquo;s going on right now. IYKYK as the kids say. Feel free to DM or contact me directly if you have good intentions.</li>
<li>Nobody is dying or sick. My family is healthy. We have a home and food on the table. We are immensely fortunate. This all reads as more serious than it actually is in some respects. I&rsquo;m an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality">enneagram 4</a> who&rsquo;s prone to fits of melancholy that I work through with creativity. Deal with it. 😊</li>
<li>Please get a counsellor if you&rsquo;re going through anything at all. Do not try to self-diagnose mental health forever. It costs $$.</li>
<li>Be ok with saying no to people around you that don&rsquo;t feel like a safe place to process or work through things with. It doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to shut them out forever. Not everyone needs to help you heal from the immediate trauma. You might need someone 6 months down the road who can help in different ways than the people who are there right now in the middle of it all.</li>

			 <p>From <a href="https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/h/r/A543B6EC2DE2A92B2540EF23F30FEDED">today&rsquo;s issue of Craig Mod&rsquo;s Seven days of walking Tokyo popup newsletter</a>, a message to the younger version of himself when he first arrived in Tokyo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know how I’d convey this, but I’d want that kid to know: He didn’t have to black himself out all the time, that things would get better. That the hole in which he felt so stuck wasn’t as deep as it seemed, and that good people would come into his orbit given time and effort. That he was directionally correct — the impulse to eschew an office job for independent work — but that that road was long and lonely and it would take ages to start paying dividends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This melds nicely with the emotion of constant ringing in my ears of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlOB3UALvrQ">Black Panther 2 trailer</a>&rsquo;s mix of <a href="https://hollywoodrecs.lnk.to/BPWFP">Tems cover</a> of Bob Marley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s Gonna Be Alright&rdquo; into <a href="https://music.apple.com/ca/album/alright/1440828886?i=1440829463">Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s Alright</a>.</p>
<p>Old white men continue to run roughshod over everything to attempt to stay relevant and in control. But I hold on to the hope that <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/11/15/arc-of-universe/">the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice</a>.</p>

			 <p>Via <a href="https://www.manton.org/2022/07/19/om-malik-instagrams.html">Manton</a>, Om Malick writes <a href="https://om.co/2022/07/18/instagram-is-dead/">Instagram is Dead</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s left is a constantly mutating product that copies features from whatever popular service — Snapchat, TikTok, or whatever. It is all about marketing and pushing substandard products and mediocre services pushed by influencers with less depth than a sheet of paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="instagram-for-me">Instagram For Me</h3>
<p>Instagram replaced Facebook for me as the place to keep up with what friends or family might be doing. I keep a personal Instagram account mainly to keep up with friends and family.  There&rsquo;s a couple accounts I follow who use it as a traditional photography app - for the rest it&rsquo;s all status updates in visual form. I go back and forth between using it to post an interesting photo I took (Instagram v1 style), and posting 9 photos and a video of a family camping trip (Instagram v5? style).</p>
<p>I also have a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lemonpodcasting/">business account</a> because I feel like I should - but I use it in spurts, and really could delete it without any noticeable impact on my business other than the time it would free up from me feeling like I need to check it.</p>
<h3 id="instagram-for-my-kids">Instagram For My Kids</h3>
<p>Seeing how my kids use Instagram, I want to hurl the app into the sun and watch it burn for a thousand years. We&rsquo;ve given our oldest 2 Instagram accounts in order to keep up with youth group activities, and naturally they&rsquo;ve connected with friends and family as well. But they spend 3 minutes checking out the photos or stories from those friends, and then the rest of their screen time allotted flipping through the Reels tab.</p>
<p>I love me some TikToks more than the average adult. But seeing my kids mindlessly swipe through Reels feels especially gross somehow. I want them to experience media, culture, and find their own funnies - but it feels like I&rsquo;m just letting them walk up to the McDonalds counter at breakfast and order a Big Mac with large fries and a coke every day. The long term effects of &ldquo;swipe away in 2 seconds if it&rsquo;s boring or not funny&rdquo; remain to be seen, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel good right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to move off of Instagram though. The only other platform used by their friends is Snapchat, and the <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/discover">discover tab</a> on Snapchat feels even more unhinged than Reels on Instagram.</p>
<p>If I could remove the Reels tab from Instagram, I&rsquo;d worry a lot less about what my kids might discover on the app.</p>
<h3 id="instagram-is-the-new-mall">Instagram Is The New Mall</h3>
<p>In an attempt to be all apps to all people, Instagram is steadily becoming the new home shopping network as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The company just announced a new creator marketplace which means creators (much like celebrities of yore that hawked wares on QVC and HSN (the Home Shopping Network) can do the same for the brands. “Social media is essentially the new roadside billboard, only it accomplishes the goal of traditional advertising in a much savvier way,” Bankrate.com analyst Sarah Foster told Fortune.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Count me out. As above, if I could remove the shopping tab from Instagram, I&rsquo;d worry a lot less about what my kids might discover on the app.</p>
<h3 id="if-not-instagram-then-what">If Not Instagram, Then What?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the answer for what to do instead because there&rsquo;s not going to be enough people moving off Instagram to move the needle anytime soon. I&rsquo;ve tried formally quitting Instagram and Facebook multiple times, but something keeps me from fulling deleting my accounts. Much like the occasional stop at McDonald&rsquo;s on the way back from camping, I can&rsquo;t quit the junk food of the internet completely.</p>
<p>For now I&rsquo;ll be over on TikTok watching the memes my kids will be watching in a month on Reels. 😆</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/07/the_2022_13-inch_macbook_air">Gruber&rsquo;s review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, there are millions of people whose computing needs would be more than met by the MacBook Air but who feel like they probably need a slightly thicker laptop with a fan on the inside and the word “Pro” stamped on the outside because their current ostensibly pro-level laptop — which may well be a MacBook Pro from Apple with Intel inside — struggles under the load of their daily work. It runs hot, the fans scream, and the battery doesn’t last long enough. Switching to this new thinner fan-less MacBook Air from a thicker MacBook Pro that makes frequent, clearly audible, use of its fan sounds like a downgrade. But for the overwhelming majority of Intel-based MacBook Pro users, it’s not. Switching to the new M2 MacBook Air would be the biggest upgrade in their computing lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel seen. :)</p>
<p>I have a 16&quot; 2019 Intel MBP that&rsquo;s fairly loaded up that I <a href="https://www.lemonproductions.ca/portfolio/">do my work on</a>, and use a family M1 Mac Mini for processing audio through filters. It&rsquo;s fine. But the fans on my MBP spin up pretty quickly for a lot of tasks, especially when I need to edit a <a href="https://www.learnwithjason.dev">Learn with Jason</a> episode in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking that my future Mac work set up lies in getting a <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> at my home office, and a <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/macbook-air-m2/">M2 MacBook Air</a> for keeping up with any work the 3 - 5 weeks of the year when I&rsquo;m not at home because we&rsquo;re on holidays, or if I want to go work at a coffee shop for a morning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My personal MacBook Pro is space gray, maxed out (no pun intended) with a 4 TB SSD and 64 GB RAM. In my daily use, this $1,900 MacBook Air feels identical to my $4,700 MacBook Pro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The M2 MacBook Air with the same 16GB RAM and 1TB storage upgrades runs $2,399+tax in Canadian dollars. Next up, configuring the Mac Studio. 😍</p>

			 <p><a href="https://microblog.chrisenns.com/2022/07/15/what-if-one.html">Speaking of Craig Mod</a>, the <a href="https://craigmod.com/roden/069/">latest issue of his newsletter</a> #69 (nice!) chronicles him catching COVID (not nice!). This summary should tell you everything you need to know to want to go read the full thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Broken penises, dizziness, isolation, emergency rooms in strange lands. I’ll be thinking about cost — first and second order costs (of which the pandemic itself is one) — the next time I’m set to fly internationally. It’s expensive, so expensive, in so many complex ways. For twenty-eight months I avoided Covid. Then I went abroad and got it almost instantly. That’s not to say the trip wasn’t “worth” it, but it was worth far less than I might have estimated ten years ago. In the end, it was largely — and to a degree, sadly — what I expected out there: Kind of a mess.</p>

			 <p>Justin Duke, creator of the great <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown email newsletter app</a>, has an &ldquo;<a href="https://www.arcana.computer/about-this-site">About This Site</a>&rdquo; for his personal blog that&rsquo;s a great read and motivator for creating a personal site.</p>
<p>This section jumped out at me as someone who <a href="https://www.lemonproductions.ca">helps create podcasts for a living</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day, though, I made the mistake of accidentally messing up my syncing on my podcatcher of choice by pulling out my iPad that hadn&rsquo;t been touched in a few months for a plane ride. For a few bizarre moments, I caught myself listening to episodes that was three months out of date. What started out as a minor annoyance (oh no, I need to spend the next three hours doing crosswords to the sound of silence!) turned into fascination and finally into horror as I realized just how irrelevant the content was — entire swaths of how I spent my day had the shelf-life of a mere fortnight or less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously I think it&rsquo;s very healthy to not spend the majority of your day tuned into podcasts, despite the fact that podcasts are what puts food on my family&rsquo;s table. I also noticed a similar thing happen when I unplugged from the daily or even weekly tech and news podcasts I was subscribed to - not much changed in what I felt I <em>knew</em>, and I had more time to spend on other things - namely editing client podcasts. :)</p>

			 <p>My friend Tim Neufeld, from my <a href="https://atu2.com">@U2 fan site and podcast days</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/653088603/posts/pfbid028afCNJ7dh7uZ2TZRXTbY8ALWUrz9QVtGkJZxRn1uRgeQjqdBkpTt4jk7wYwSRh5wl/?d=n">posted his thoughts</a> about an <a href="https://mbherald.com/on-holy-ground-book-reprinted-at-request-of-usmb-and-ccmbc-boards/">article published in the MB Herald</a> detailing the mess that the <a href="https://www.mennonitebrethren.ca">Canadian Conference of of Mennonite Brethren Churches</a> and their US equivalent, <a href="https://usmb.org">USMB</a>, made of a recent book they published, and then quickly pulled and removed 3 pages, and have now republished - all without talking to the author, editor, or anyone involved in the publishing of the book.</p>
<p>Setting that mess aside, my point in mentioning all of that is part of what Tim wrote hit way too close to home here in my own church that I was compelled to document it  below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…but one value I have always prioritized is to honor voices of diversity, not just in theory but in practice. Many leaders are fearful these days. That fear shapes a leadership culture of defensiveness rather than openness. Voices of disagreement are threatening when denominations and churches face peril on multiple levels (declining attendance, closure of facilities, damage control after scandals, reduction of budgets and staff, challenges to old patriarchal assumptions, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Three critical qualities are needed in both local and national leadership as we hurl through the chaos and upheaval of these changing times. (1) Absolutely essential is the capacity for self-reflection and the ability to see oneself as others would see them. We are dead in the water without the wind of self-awareness. (2) Similarly, the need for empathy and the desire to empathically hear and feel those that are voiceless, marginalized, and victimized on the edges, without leaders projecting their own pain onto those that have been hurt by leaders' actions (red flag warning: &ldquo;It hurts me to do this, but&hellip;&quot;). (3) Finally, rather than belittling and controlling, leaders should focus on empowering members into new thoughts and experiences without feeling threatened and without seeing leadership&rsquo;s primary role as theological gatekeeper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When leadership acts out of fear, and without empathy, the community they are trying to lead are pushed to anger or apathy - neither of which bring peace or love back to the community.</p>

			 <p>Matt Haughey <a href="https://twitter.com/mathowie/status/1547634821945368581">wrote a Twitter thread today</a> referencing his experience back in 2018 of <a href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/2018/11/15/visiting-the-whitney-plantation-slavery-museum/">visiting the Whitney Museum in New Orleans</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d read Just Mercy, I’ve read the People’s History of the United States, I’ve read a bunch of Ta-Nehisi Coates, so I naively thought I had some idea of how bad slavery was. After visiting and hearing the stories from my guide and seeing the displays, I really had no clue. Think of the worst thing you can possibly imagine that one human being might do to another and know that what really took place was a hundred times worse.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if or when I&rsquo;ll ever be in New Orleans, but I hope I can someday take my family to visit this museum. Much like visiting the museums and memorials to the holocaust in Germany, which I was lucky enough to do with my family back in 2000, it&rsquo;s important to know where and what we&rsquo;ve come from - and in North America, the generational destruction that is slavery is a huge part of the foundation of what we&rsquo;re all standing on today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The darkness and brutality of slavery was evident from start to finish on the tour. In the “Gold Coast” around New Orleans, slaves lived for only 7-10 years after arriving on plantations in the region, no matter what their starting ages were. Slave owners insured their property (including their slaves) and would get up to 75% of their investment back when slaves died, so plantation owners had every incentive to work everyone to death, making many times over what they paid thanks to their free labor and when their slaves did die, owners were rewarded by recouping most of their original investment. The entire economic system was designed to support it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know here in Canada we have our own <a href="https://nctr.ca">reckoning with the past</a> that we continue to make a mess of even today, in light of all that we know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the answers for how to heal from the past atrocities. But I do know that actively working to deny they happened is <a href="https://twitter.com/mathowie/status/1547634835904090115?s=21&amp;t=-C0x5dgGbj9kWDEBygTCcA">among the worst ways to process and help healing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like the rise in conspiracy theories is due to so much more concrete information and data out there and people saying they can’t possibly believe what they see with their own eyes, instead it just HAS to be something else that doesn’t undermine their own beliefs.</p>

			 <p>Just a reminder that social media posts and stories don’t represent the entirety of a person you follow on social media. It’s a glimpse into part of their day, an emotion they felt for a fleeting second, filtered and edited, or something they did months ago that they’re presenting as current. Or it might be completely made up. Rarely can you know why they posted it. And your guess is very likely wrong. Unless you’re in conversation with them semi-regularly, you don’t really know them or what they think about a specific issue, event, or thing.</p>
<p>Speaking personally, I’m always open to conversations about what I have posted as long as you remember I don’t take things very seriously on social media - except for the things I do. 😆</p>
<p>I’ve been on twitter since 2006 and playing on the internet since way before that. It’s where everything is made up and the points don’t matter. Something you think is so important today, you won’t even remember 2 years from now. And in 5 years it will be wiped off the internet after the corporations have bought and sold our content into oblivion.</p>
<p>So have fun!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m so glad Apple decided to split apart <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647182/apple-itunes-podcasts-music-tv-mac-os-wwdc-2019">Podcasts into it&rsquo;s own app</a>. Initially I was skeptical that it made sense - why not have podcasts in the same &ldquo;store&rdquo; as where everyone was already going for music or movies or TV? It&rsquo;s all media.</p>
<p>Now 3 years later it really looks like it was the right choice, at least from a user experience perspective. Obviously I have no insider knowledge on usage stats from Spotify or Apple, but <a href="https://rachsmith.com/spotify-podcasts-should-be-a-separate-app/">Rachel Smith&rsquo;s experience sums up the sentiment I keep hearing from Spotify users</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the blessed pre-Spotify Podcasts days, I was a huge Spotify fan. I was paying for a subscription as soon as it was available in my region. Now I curse Spotify whenever they take away podcast content I previously enjoyed: Brené Brown, basically all of Gimlet. I say &ldquo;take away&rdquo; because I refuse to use their shitty excuse for a podcast-app-shoved-in-a-music-player that has made my once-great-music-player experience worse! Damn you Spotify, I won&rsquo;t do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like I said, without actual user data it&rsquo;s impossible for me to say &ldquo;Spotify&rsquo;s approach is economically worse than Apple&rsquo;s&rdquo;, and I don&rsquo;t know what kind of testing Spotify is doing to determine if a separate app would generate more revenue, but it certainly <em>feels</em> like it&rsquo;s a better experience over all.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve long been a fan of <a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com">Rogue Amoeba</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/fission/">Fission</a> software for lossless audio editing. I use it if I forget to cut off the end of a podcast&rsquo;s MP3 file, or cut out a piece of audio that I can make a clean cut of without worrying about the rest of the edit. Or to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0DFcaNYOH0">split large audio files into smaller ones</a>.</p>
<p>When Fission saves it back to an MP3, it does it in a lossless way. (Rogue Amoeba has a <a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/support/knowledgebase/?showArticle=FissionLosslessEditing">support doc explaining how they do it if you&rsquo;re curious</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to a client - <a href="https://blog.codepen.io/radio/">Stephen Shaw over at CodePen Radio</a>, I learned about <a href="https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut">Lossless Cut</a>, an open source app for that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;aims to be the ultimate cross platform FFmpeg GUI for extremely fast and lossless operations on video, audio, subtitle and other related media files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To try it out, I pulled up a video of a recent <a href="https://www.learnwithjason.dev">Learn with Jason</a> episode I had edited and added chapter markers to for YouTube. With a click of a button I could export all the chapter segments into individual video files which would make for really easy social media clips, or a library of videos on a specific topic that could be smashed together into a compilation video.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And it took less than 5 minutes to export all of them out of the original video. Slick!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Lossless Cut is free to use if you <a href="https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases/">download it from the GitHub repo</a> - look for the one labelled &lsquo;LosslessCut-mac-x64.dmg&rsquo; - or you can <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1505323402">buy it from the Mac App Store</a> as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut#difference-between-app-stores-and-github-download">differences between the GitHub download vs Mac App Store</a> shouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal for most people, and may actually be the more stable version of the app if you&rsquo;re using it for critical work related editing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They have exactly the same in-app features, except for a few platform limitations. Apple doesn&rsquo;t allow opening VOB files with App Store apps. Apple App Store apps need to prompt for output directory. LosslessCut version in the App Stores is a few versions behind the GitHub version, because I want to be sure that the new versions work perfectly before releasing in the App Stores. GitHub version can contain new, untested features and may contain some bugs.</p>

			 <p>I, <a href="https://rachsmith.com/fuck-it/">and others</a>, have been motivated to blog more simply because of Chris Coyier&rsquo;s recent uptick of posts on <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">his own blog</a>.</p>
<p>I appreciate his <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/06/27/there-is-no-bar/">recent post</a> reminding everyone that there is no bar you have to attain before you hit publish:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to write better individual blog posts, but something has always compelled me to punt out a thought early rather than wait until I have some perfect way to present it. And for the record, I don’t mind reading your posts like that either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a big part of my motivation to move my blog off my nerdy <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> set up and set everything up with my <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> account. Between the web interface, <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/micro-blog-for-mac/45">macOS app</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/micro-blog/id1253201335">iOS app</a> - it makes it so much easier for me to fire off a quick tweet style post or something longer like this without having to worry about anything needing to be updated first, or breaking something while trying to simply publish a quick thought.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> at Micro.blog has been super helpful trying to sort out my issues moving my blogging archive from <a href="https://chrisenns.com">ChrisEnns.com</a> into Micro.blog - and once I get that sorted I&rsquo;ll move this blog off my subdomain to my main site.</p>
<p>For the record I still am really excited about the Jamstack style of publishing websites. I&rsquo;m just not nerdy enough to be able to maintain a site like that AND have time to publish anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just press and hold the buttons on both sides. Remember that. Try it now. Don’t just memorize it, internalize it, so that you’ll be able to do it without much thought while under duress, like if you’re confronted by a police officer. Remember to do this every time you’re separated from your phone, like when going through the magnetometer at any security checkpoint, especially airports. As soon as you see a metal detector ahead of you, you should think, “Hard-lock my iPhone”.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t understand why I&rsquo;d buy an M1 based Mac Studio when the M2 based MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are out right now - so clearly there&rsquo;s going to be an M2 based Mac Studio coming.</p>
<p>The obvious deciding factor would be &ldquo;Do you need a faster Mac right now or can you afford to wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="">This post on MacRumors.com helps sort out the differences between the two chips</a> - but everything I read there tells me I should wait before taking an M-based plunge with my main <a href="https://lemonproductions.ca">work</a> machine - I currently have a <a href="https://chrisenns.com/uses/">2019 16&quot; MacBook Pro</a>.</p>
<p>This paragraph jumped out at me as a reason to wait for the M2 based Mac Studio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both the ‌M1‌ and the ‌M2‌ have dedicated video encode and decode engines for hardware-accelerated H.264 and HEVC, but the ‌M2‌'s video engines are also able to accelerate ProRes and ProRes RAW to enable playback of multiple streams of 4K and 8K video. In addition, the ‌M2‌'s media engine includes a higher-bandwidth video decoder, supporting 8K H.264 and HEVC video.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do a lot of 4K video right now for clients, but when I do - rendering is the biggest bottleneck to creativity and getting my work done efficiently.</p>
<p>I recently heard someone talk about how fast their M1 Max MacBook Pro is at rendering video on a <a href="https://syntax.fm">client&rsquo;s podcast</a> and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s got me feeling the itch to upgrade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a chicken and the egg for me right now. If I upgrade to a Mac Studio, I&rsquo;ll get more work done which will allow me to make more money and then be able to more easily afford upgrading to a Mac Studio. 😊</p>

			 <p>While reading <a href="https://micro.blog/davatron5000">@davatron5000</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/12/vibe-check-11/">recent Vibe Check</a>, he mentions uninstalling Twitter for iOS as a way of avoiding temptation to get pulled in to the drama &amp; arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the Web3 hype (as well as Politics Twitter) actually made me uninstall Twitter from my iPad and iPhone… and I kind of love it. I’m unplugged from the outrage machine and it’s much quieter. Stomping the urge to reinstall the app or log in from Mobile Safari for some dumb tweet is the hardest part, but I’m so far successful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which reminded me of how I (think I?) had set up Micro.blog as a way of posting to Twitter without having to actually open up Twitter. Might have to revisit this over the winter when I&rsquo;m more likely to lay on the couch and mindlessly scroll Twitter instead of doing something moderately more productive with my time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not too drawn into politics or the outrage machine - for me it&rsquo;s the social validation and interactions of posting a good tweet or photo, and then hoping for likes or replies.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s see where this post ends up. :)</p>
